## Activity name
Determine customer participants for scoping

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer
- _PA Scoper_

## Guidance
It is crucial that the right people from the customer participate in the scoping.  In addition to the dedicated platform team or application development, any other resources required to execute the Platform Dojo / Application Transformation service should participate in the scoping to ensure that everyone understands and agrees upon the goal of the service.

Here are some possible additional participants for the scoping.  This is not an all inclusive list, as every customer is different.

- Business stakeholder or sponsor
- Enterprise architecture
- Network / firewall
- Load balancing
- Middleware
- Security
- Storage
- Server

## Outcomes
An agreed-upon list of all required participants for the scoping.
