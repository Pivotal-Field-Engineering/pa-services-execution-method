## Activity name
Application portfolio review

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Application Owners
- _Customer Project Managers_

## Guidance
The first step in identifying candidate applications for Application Transformation is to review the customer's application portfolio.  After [Cloud Native Enablement]({{< ref "cloud-native-enablement.md" >}}), the customer _should_ be able to identify the relative ease of migrating applications to PCF (if they can't, spend more time on [Cloud Native Enablement]({{< ref "cloud-native-enablement.md" >}})).

Review the customer's application portfolio, and attempt to identify 3-5 candidate applications that are easy to migrate to PCF and are also high impact applications.  A good starting point is to create a graph quadrant with the customer, where the x axis is business or stakeholder impact, and the y axis is ease of replatforming.  Applications that land in the upper right quadrant (easily replatformed and high impact) are good candidates for Application Transformation.
