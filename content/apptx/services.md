## Activity name
PCF and enterprise services

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer's Development Teams

## Guidance
It is important to understand what platform-managed and existing enterprise services the candidate applications will need.  This activity involves detailing all of these services.  Services generally fall into several buckets:

- Relational databases
- NoSQL databases
- Message brokers
- Web services
- Management and monitoring
- Distributed system patterns
- Security

Having a detailed list of what services will need to be installed in the platform and what enterprise services will need to be accessed by applications is necessary to ensure that the applications can be successfully replatformed.

## Outcome
A list of platform-managed services and enterprise services needed, along with information such as access rights, IP addresses and ports, and capacity needed.
