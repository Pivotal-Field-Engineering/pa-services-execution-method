## Activity name
Identify customer's platform team

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- _Account Executive_

## Guidance
It is imperative that the customer have a dedicated team to operate the platform.  Many customers struggle with PCF because they have not dedicated a team to it, and instead have tried to share resources from other groups.

The dedicated platform team needs to be identified prior other activities, as this team should be involved in the other activities for background and context.  The team should include:

- Platform Champion
- Product Manager
- Platform Reliability Engineers
- Designer (part-time)

For more information on these roles, see [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kVEEMf5rHQ9MB19V0YNbNFqIfezcgGeZPOT2KRkhRDg/edit#slide=id.g2795038439_1_1516).

## Outcomes
A small, dedicated team identified that is responsible for providing the platform as a product.
