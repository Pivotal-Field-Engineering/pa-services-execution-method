## Activity name
Identify initial application to deploy

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer's Product Team
- _Customer's Application Teams_

## Guidance
One of the success criteria for almost every Platform Dojo is that one of the customer's applications is deployed to the platform and can be demonstrated.  This is to show that the platform is installed and configured and ready to host applications; it is not meant to demonstrate [replatforming of applications]({{< ref "/apptx/summary.md" >}}).

As such, the candidate application should be simple and be able to be deployed to PCF with minimal change.  Ideally, this application is a simple Spring Boot or .NET Core application with minimal service dependencies.  If such an application can't be identified, then a simple database-driven Spring Boot application can be written for this activity.

## Outcome
A candidate application for deployment to PCF is identified.
