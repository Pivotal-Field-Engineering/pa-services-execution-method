## Activity name
Infrastructure planning and procurement

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer's Product Team
- Other teams from the customer as needed

## Guidance
The customer needs to ensure that they have the appropriate infrastructure installed and configured prior to the beginning of the Platform Dojo.  This involves several steps:

- [Deployment topology design](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W2sOg1NDD39N6jeyMmKjiE1I_PXMpfBFRJp8hIxydOU) (multi-DC, product, pre-production, sandbox)
- [Initial capacity planning](http://pcfsizer.pivotal.io/)
- Ordering of hardware
- Hardware installation and configuration
- IaaS setup
- Infrastructure provisioning (network, firewall, load balancer, DNS, SSL)

This activity is a long process and should be started as soon as feasible, as it will likely overlap several other activities.

## Outcome
The customer's infrastructure is installed and provisioned and ready for platform installation.
