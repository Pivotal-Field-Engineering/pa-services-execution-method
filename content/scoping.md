## Activity name
Execute scoping

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- PA Scoper
- Solution Architect
- Account Executive
- CNS Representative
- Customer (designated attendees)

## Guidance
Scoping is a 1-2 hour meeting between the customer, the account team, and the delivery team.  Scoping has a few goals:

- Desired outcomes and risks
- To whittle down all of the possible to manageable scope
- To set expectations with the customer around dojo processes, logistics, and team dedication
- To ensure that all 3 parties have the same goals and expectations

The PA Scoper will lead the scoping session, with input from the SA.  The important concept here is the PA and account team have done all of the necessary enablement, design work, and other prerequisites to ensure the scoping is a review and agreement.  The scoping session should not turn into an education or design session.

## Outcome
An agreed upon scope of work and goals by the customer, account team, and delivery team, from which a proposal can be created.  This scope of work will usually be in the form of a digital whiteboard.
