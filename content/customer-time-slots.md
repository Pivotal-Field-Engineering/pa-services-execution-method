## Activity name
Request time slots from customer for scoping

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer

## Guidance
The PA should request 3 2-hour time slots from the customer to schedule the scoping.  The participants from the [Identify Scoping Participants]({{< ref "scoping-participants.md#outcome">}}) activity should all be available for these time slots.  These time slots will be used to coordinate the SA for the scoping in the [Enter Request in Recombinator]({{< ref "recombinator.md#description" >}}) activity.

## Outcome
3 2-hour time slots to propose for SA participation in the scoping.
