Identify the opportunity

## Participants
- Account executive
- CNS Representative
- Platform Architect
- Customer

## Guidance
There are 4 types of professional services available to support customers.  These are:

1. [Platform dojo]({{< ref "#platform-dojo" >}})
1. [Platform reliability engineer (PRE)]({{< ref "#pre" >}})
1. [Application Transformation (AppTx)]({{< ref "#apptx" >}})
1. [Pivotal Labs]({{< ref "#labs" >}})

The process to execute an engagement depends on the type of engagement, so it is important to propose the right type(s) of engagement.  Always engage with the Cloud Native Services (CNS) representative to ensure the right engagements are being proposed.

### Platform Dojo {#platform-dojo}

A Platform Dojo is intended to enable customers to install, configure, and operate the platform based on our best practices and experience.  A Platform Dojo is designed to be a pairing engagement with 1 or 2 of the customer's platform operators and PCFS Solution Architects.  Examples of some outcomes from tradition platform dojos are:

- HA installation of platform
- Concourse pipelines for platform automation
- Org and space structure and design
- Integration with enterprise systems, such as identity management, databases, and monitoring tools
- Routing and URL naming schemes

A Platform Dojo should always be included with a new customer PCF deal.  This will help ensure that the customer is enabled on Pivotal's best practices and reference architectures.

### Platform Reliability Engineer {#pre}

A Platform Reliability Engineer (PRE) is an extension to the Platform Dojo.  A PRE is a Pivotal resource assigned for 10 weeks to assist customers who aren't comfortable operating the platform after a Platform Dojo.  A PRE is not meant to be a staff augmentation, rather it is meant to be a way to support customers' platform teams for a period longer than a Platform Dojo lasts.

A PRE can be proposed in conjunction with a Platform Dojo if the customer wants that type of engagement.  The two offerings should be proposed together as they typically overlap a few weeks so that the PRE is familiar with the customer and context.

### Application Transformation {#apptx}

Application Transformation (AppTx) engagements are meant to assist customers replatform or modernize existing applications.  It is an onsite pairing engagement targeted at a few applications in the customer's portfolio.  As with other engagements AppTx is intended to enable the customer to continue transformation exercises by themselves, and not as a long term staff augmentation role.

AppTx typically targets a handful of representative applications that have high business value, are technically aligned with PCF requirements, and would quickly demonstrate the value of PCF to customer stakeholders.  Typical applications include:

- JEE applications (WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss)
- .NET Framework applications
- Web / digital applications (Node.JS, Python, static)
- Mobile back-end applications

AppTx engagements are usually included with new customer PCF deals when they have existing applications that would benefit from being moved to PCF and adopting cloud native principles.  Additional standalone AppTx engagements are common too, as customers begin realizing value from PCF and want to transform more applications.

AppTx is targeted at existing applications, whether it's doing the bare minimum to move existing applications to PCF, or a more comprehensive effort to modernize existing applications.  AppTx is not appropriate for new application development.

### Pivotal Labs {#labs}

Pivotal Labs engagements are intended for customers who want to transform their software delivery practices (a.k.a. "The Pivotal Way").  Labs engagements achieve this by having customers come to a Labs office and pairing with them in the development of a new project.  Labs engagements are rarely, if ever, done at a customer's site.

Pivotal Labs engagements are transacted differently than other engagements.  They don't necessarily require a PCF purchase or other Pivotal resources.  As such, the PA involvement is much different than with other engagements, and the rest of this method doesn't cover Pivotal Labs.  If you feel there might be a Pivotal Labs opportunity, work with your CNS representative and Pivotal Labs office director.
