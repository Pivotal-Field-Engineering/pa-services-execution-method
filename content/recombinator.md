## Activity name
Enter request in Recombinator

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Solution Architect

## Guidance
[Recombinator](https://recombinator.cfapps.io) is the tool that PCFS uses to track scoping requests, amongst other things.  Once the [customer participants]({{< ref "scoping-participants.md#outcome" >}}) have been defined and [available time slots]({{< ref "customer-time-slots.md#outcome" >}}) have been collected, that information can be entered into a new scoping request.

Once the new scoping request has been submitted, post a message in the [pcf-scoping channel in Slack](https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/C28MSRACX/details/) referencing the scoping request ID and PA scoper and requesting a PCFS Solution Architect (SA) to attend.  If you don't get a response in 24 hours, you may need to bump the message a couple of times.

## Outcome
An SA assigned to attend the scoping, and a confirmed date and time for the scoping.
