## Activity name
Dojo process enablement

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- CNS Representative
- Customer

## Guidance
It is important that the customer team understands the Dojo process and requirements to start the engagement.  Many customers are used to traditional professional services engagements like staff augmentation, and the pairing, iterative PCFS method requires a different mindset to be successful.

The PA and CNS representative should make sure the customer understands several unique aspects of PCFS enagements:

- Iteration[0] team
- Pre-engagement call
- Iteration Planning Meetings
- Retrospectives
- Backlog planning and pruning
- Dedicated teams

If these concepts are unfamiliar, make sure you engage with your CNS representative or PCFS to ensure that these concepts are well understood by the customer.  

## Outcome
Understanding and agreement by the customer for the "Pivotal Way" of engagements.
