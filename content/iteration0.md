## Activity name
Engage Iteration[0] team

## Participants
- CNS Representative
- Platform Architect

## Guidance
Iteration[0] is the PCFS team responsible for reviewing the contract, prerequisites, and other activities performed and assigning a PCFS team to execute the engagement.  At this point in the process, the Iteration[0] team needs to be engaged so that they can start their process.

The CNS representative will normally enage Iteration[0].  However their will probably be questions or even additional items needed.  This activity is designed to answer any questions they may have, or to gather the additional items.

Note that one of the things that the Iteration[0] team will start asking for is the appropriate [data collectors]({{< ref "data-collectors.md" >}}) to be completed.  This is described in the next activity, but can be started at any point after the [SOW is approved]({{< ref "transaction.md" >}}).

## Outcome
Iteration[0] team engaged, briefed, and has approved moving forward.
