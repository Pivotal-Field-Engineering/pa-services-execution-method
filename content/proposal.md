## Activity name
Determine proposed scope of engagement

## Participants
- CNS Representative
- PA Scoper
- Platform Architect
- Account Executive
- Customer
- _Solution Architect_

## Guidance
Once the scoping has been completed, the account team should agree on the proposed size and length of the engagement.  The PA Scoper should provide the suggested size and length of the enagement.  Platform Dojos and Application Transformations are proposed based on a combination of size and length.

For the size, there are 3 options:

- Small - 2.25 Pivotal resources
- Medium - 3.25 Pivotal resources
- Large - 4.25 Pivotal resources

For the length, engagements are sold in 2-week increments, with a minimum of (2) 2-week increments. 

A typical proposal will be something like a 6-week medium Platform Dojo, for example.  Most Platform Dojos are medium sized, between 6 and 8 weeks.  Proposing a large Platform Dojo requires the customer to dedicate more resources and is usually not feasible.  Application Transformations are usually medium or large in size and between 6 and 8 weeks in length.

## Outcome
A Statement of Work (SOW) for the engagement, including size, length, and pricing.
