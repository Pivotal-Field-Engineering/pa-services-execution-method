This site describes the method for Pivotal Platform Architects (PAs) to execute and transition Pivotal Services with customers.  There are many steps and activities that need to be done to execute a Pivotal service, and this site describes the framework for execution.

The layout of this site starts with a summary of activities for all services, and then branches into activities for different types of services, like Platform Dojos and Application Transformation.  To follow the method start with the [Method Summary]({{< ref "summary.md" >}}), and then follow the [Platform Dojo]({{< ref "platform/summary.md" >}}) or [Application Transformation]({{< ref "apptx/summary.md" >}}) paths.  Each activity has guidance pages that you can read or brush up on as well.

Each activity page has the following format:

- **Activity name** - The name of the activity in the process.
- **Participants** - Which roles participate in the activity.  Optional participants are in _italics_.  Unless otherwise noted, the PA is ultimately responsible for the activity.
- **Guidance** - A description of the activity, how to accomplish the activity, and other guidance.
- **Outcome** - What the desired outcome or deliverable of the activity is.

The PA should maintain all of the electronic artifacts of this process in a subfolder of the account folder, referenced in the "Google Docs" section in the SalesForce opportunity.
