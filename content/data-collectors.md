## Activity name
Fill out Data Collectors

## Participants
- Platform Architect
- Customer
- _Solution Architect_

## Guidance
There are a number of documents and spreadsheets that PCFS will need to be filled out, known as "Data Collectors".  The Iteration[0] team will provide a complete list of Data Collectors needed.  However, these collectors typically take a while to fill out, so this activity can be started once the [transaction is executed]({{< ref "transaction.md" >}}).

## Outcome
All of the required data collectors filled out and submitted to PCFS.
